Computer Geometry project 6

Study Project. This is my project. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. 
My project is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. 
Without me, my project is useless. Without my project, I am useless. I must write my project true. 
I must code straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. 
I will. 
Before God I swear this creed: my project and myself are defenders of my country, 
we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. 
So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. 
Amen
